    <h1>EDM Council FIBO Glossary</h1>
    <p>
      Generated from the OWL, the FIBO glossary is a list of classes and properties defined in FIBO, including their logical definition, curated natural language definition and synonyms where available.  As with all of FIBO, there is a Production version of the Glossary, which includes definitions of terms that have been vetted by the FIBO content teams, as well as a Development version, which includes terms that are currently being developed.

      There are four ways to work with the FIBO Glossary.

<ol>
<li>	<a href="#WS">Web Searchable</a></li>
<li>	<a href="#CSV">Downloadable as a .csv for working in a spreadsheet</a></li>
<li>	<a href="#XLS">Downloadable as a .xlsx for working in a spreadsheet</a></li>
<li>	<a href="#NOTE">Downloadable as RDF annotations for use with FIBO itself</a></li>
</ol>


The glossary incudes human-readable versions of the logical relationships in FIBO that are represented in OWL.  These definitions are available on their own as annotations on the FIBO classes in <a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/LogicalAnnotations.rdf">rdf-xml</a> and <a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/LogicalAnnotations.ttl">ttl</a> formats. 


<h2><a name="WS">Web Searchable </a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="production.html">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="development.html">Development</a></li>
</ul>
A user-friendly web page that includes label, curated definition, synonyms (where available) and model-generated definitions for all classes and properties in FIBO. 
<p>Example:</p>
<img border="1" src="../image/glossary1.png" width="80%"/>

 
<h2><a name="CSV">Comma Separated Values format</a></h2>
A comma-separated file with the same information as the web page; label, curated defintion, synonyms and model-generated defintion.  For use in spreadsheets, including Excel.  
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/2018Q4/glossary-prod.csv">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/glossary-dev.csv">Development</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="XLS">Excel format</a></h2>

A file that can be read with Microsoft Excel, containing label, curated definition, synonyms, model-generated definition, examples and explanatory notes (when available).  Exclusively for use with Excel, this file includes formatting to make the spreadsheet easier to read. 


<ul>
  <li><a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/2018Q4/glossary-prod.xlsx">Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/glossary-dev.xlsx">Development</a></li>
 </ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<img border="1" src="../image/glossary2.png" width="80%" alt="glossary example"/>
<p/>

<h2><a name="NOTE">Downloadable RDF Annotations</a></h2>
For application developer who want to be able to query for the human-readable versions of the FIBO logic, that is avaiable in <a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/LogicalAnnotations.ttl">ttl</a> and <a href="../../fibo/glossary/master/latest/LogicalAnnotations.rdf">RDF/XML</a> formats.
