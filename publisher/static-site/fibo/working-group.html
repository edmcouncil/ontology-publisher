The FLT manages the FIBO repository, adjudicates changes in GitHub and JIRA, ensures the alignment of FIBO with existing standards, maintains the FIBO process flow and ensures technical governance for the standard.

                       FND Team is responsible for designing the basic building blocks of FIBO. FIBO Foundations deals with the underlying concepts of contracts, agents, agreements, transactions, processes, dates, time, goals, legal concepts including jurisdiction and capacity, organizational types, the meaning of ownership and control, the concept of parties and roles, baseline concepts associated with products and services, the fundamental accounting concepts, units of measure, quantities and schedules. FIBO Foundations is the essential scaffolding upon which the other FIBO modules are constructed.

                        BE/DER Team is responsible for one of the content foundational components of the ontology. It addresses concepts related to the types of entities that exist across the financial system including corporations, functional entities, partnerships, private limited companies, sole proprietorships, trusts, government entities and distinct types of legal entities. FIBO BE/DER also focuses on the concepts of ownership and control covering the types of parties that exist along with expression of their capacities and powers. Moreover, FIBO BE/DER is a baseline domain ontology defining equities (equity instruments, depository receipts, equity issuance, limited partnership equity, shareholder rights and shareholder equity), bonds (concepts relating to cash debt instruments, listings, tax treatment, debt guarantees, parity variants, participation notes and cash flow), money markets (REPOs, term deposits and short term debt), and other securities (baskets, parametric schedules, pools, securities classification, securities identification, issuance, listings, restrictions and assets). <a class="bttn" id="email_1524650877557" href="mailto:rtrypuz@edmcouncil.org?subject=Request%20to%20Join%20FIBO%20BEDER%20Team">Apply to join team</a>

These common concepts are linked to many other financial contract domain and process areas in FIBO. Moreover, FBC/SEC is a baseline domain ontology defining equities (equity instruments, depository receipts, equity issuance, limited partnership equity, shareholder rights and shareholder equity), bonds (concepts relating to cash debt instruments, listings, tax treatment, debt guarantees, parity variants, participation notes and cash flow), money markets (REPOs, term deposits and short term debt), and other securities (baskets, parametric schedules, pools, securities classification, securities identification, issuance, listings, restrictions and assets). <a class="bttn" id="email_1524650877557" href="mailto:rtrypuz@edmcouncil.org?subject=Request%20to%20Join%20FIBO%20FBCSEC%20Team">Apply to join team</a>
