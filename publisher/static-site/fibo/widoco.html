    <p>
 

      The Wizard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO) displays FIBO as a set 
      of interlinked documents for each component ontology, along with 
      an interactive VOWL diagram of the classes and relationships in the ontology. 
<br/>

      The WIDOCO documentation includes  a <a href="../../fibo/widoco/master/2018Q3/vowltreeProd.html"><i>Production</i></a>
      version, which includes definitions of classes and properties that have been vetted by the FIBO
      content teams, as well as a <a href="../../fibo/widoco/master/latest/vowltreeDev.html"><i>Development</i></a>
      version, which includes classes and properties that are currently being developed.

      content teams, as well as a <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/glossary/master/2018Q3/development.html"><i>Development</i></a>
