# Cached Ontologies

Place all your external ontologies here. 

The script [publisher/product/ontology/build-cats.sh](../../../publisher/product/ontology/build-cats.sh)
will generate the Jena's location mapping file `location-mapping.n3`,
adding all neccessary external ontologies from this directory and subdirectories.
